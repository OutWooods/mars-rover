I did the actual technical part in 2:45 (with 30 minutes planning before hand - apologies, I did this over the time limit).

# Next steps

1) More tests of the lost functionality, I think this was a less good part, and I'd like to look at better was of organising this code.

2) More feature tests - for a wider range of scenarios

3) More time refactoring - formating the user imput, I would potentially extract out to a formatter class (rather than give the control_center responsibility for it).

4) Looked at alternative implementations for the move method - the robots tests got very long so it would be good to find ways to extract some of its responsibilities potentially.
